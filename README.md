# mermaid-template

A place to get started making static pages with Mermaid.

## Usage

This repo can be cloned to use mermaid locally to render charts and .html pages.

There are two steps to render each mermaid graph:

1. Create a .mermaid file in the data directory.
2. Create a corresponding <pre> tag in index.html for the graph to render into.
