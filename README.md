# mermaid-template

A place to get started making static pages with Mermaid.

## Usage

This repo can be cloned to use mermaid locally to render charts and .html pages.

There are two steps to render each mermaid graph:

1. Create a .mermaid file in the data directory.
2. Create a corresponding pre tag in index.html for the graph to render into.

Once your .index and .mermaid files are setup you can run a local http server from the same directory.
